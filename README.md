# Narma
Unit Test NodeJS and all it's node_modules with Karma and Jasime (or what have you)

Node runs natively in [NW.JS](http://nwjs.io/) and I kinda like Karma (and Jasime).
So I thought to run a script launcher and unit test my node server (on the server).

To install:

      npm install
      npm install -g nodewebkit
      
To run, you must change the path to the script launcher in karam.conf.js
and then run:

      karma start


(only tested this on mac)
